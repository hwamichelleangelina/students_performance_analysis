# Students' Performance Analysis & Dropout Early Prediction

This project explores the **key factors influencing student dropout** at Jaya Jaya Institut through **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, statistical testing, machine learning models for early prediction, and dashboard visualization to support proactive academic interventions and improve student retention.

## Business Understanding:

* **Objective:** Help Jaya Jaya Institute identify and predict students who are at risk of dropping out as early as possible, so they can receive special guidance before they actually leave the institution.

* **Main Problem:** The high dropout rate poses a major challenge to the institution's reputation and quality. A lack of understanding of the main causes makes preventive efforts less effective.

* **Problem Statement (Business Questions):**

  * What are the main factors that most influence a student's decision to drop out?
  * What are the decision-supporting features that indirectly influence these factors?
  * How can the institution efficiently monitor student performance and take timely action?

* **Target:**

  * Explore and understand student data patterns through machine learning to predict dropout probability.
  * Identify data-driven strategies and solutions to reduce the dropout rate and improve student retention.
  * Provide data visualizations for academic staff to monitor student performance and take data-based preventive actions.
